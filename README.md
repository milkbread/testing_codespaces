# UserStoryMappingAtJupyter 4 Text+

This project offers a simple possibility to extract UserStoryModells
from the [UserStories of the Text+ consortium](https://www.text-plus.org/forschungsdaten/user-stories/), within [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

It is a fork of [Markdown2UserStoryMappingAtJupyter](https://gitlab.hrz.tu-chemnitz.de/jupyter/markdown2userstorymappingatjupyter) where some basics
get demonstrated:
    - building a UserStoryMapping from Markdown files
    - how to use such a repository in combination with [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)
    - how relevant requirements get installed automatically
